# Biosensor Framework: A C# Static Library for Generic Affective Computing

Developed in the Virtual Reality Laboratory at the Munroe Meyer Institute, this library provides an interface for interacting with biosensors and performing affective computing tasks on their output data streams.  Currently, it natively supports the Empatica E4 and communicates through a TCP connection with their provided server.
